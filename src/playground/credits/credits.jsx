                I use some MIT licensed extensions from TurboWarp as they are really useful!

                but I still need to credit these people!

            <h2>Translators</h2>
            <p>
                More than 100 people have helped translate TurboWarp and its addons into many languages —
                far more than we could hope to list here.
            </p>
            <p>
                DISTROT is also 50% more slower than penguinmod (very very slowly) getting translated into other languages, because i have no goddamn idea how.
                hopefully the same number of languages can be supported. It'll take a very long while until i get there though.
